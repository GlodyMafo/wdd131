        "description": "For some, art is secondary; for others, it is vital. It's impossible to think about life, to be in life, to be alive without being connected to art. Meschack Moyengo Kadima is one of those souls for whom the question of engaging with art never even arose. Destiny proved stronger than man. A self-taught and multidisciplinary artist, it is through painting that his path stands out—or rather, through the art of being himself.",
